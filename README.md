# OpenGL For Mac
This is some sample code to get my [OpenGL library](https://github.com/giawa/opengl4csharp) up and running on Mac OS X.  This project will open in Xamarin Studio with the [Mono Framework](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) installed.  It should also work in Mono Develop and Visual Studio, but both of those are untested.

## Building the Project
This project includes a .sln and .csproj file which will initialize a window using [GLUT](http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) and then will draw a cube in wireframe mode.  You can check out the write-up for this project at [http://giawa.com](http://giawa.com)
